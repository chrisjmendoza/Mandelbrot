# Mandelbrot
Based on an assignment from my AD315 class, Discrete Mathematics in Computer Programming, a Processing program to draw the mandelbrot fractal.

Plans are to add features as I progress in programming. I would like to add a zoom feature from a mouse selection, as well as increase the amount of detail. I would also like to have more detail inside of the swirls along the edge of the bulbs.
